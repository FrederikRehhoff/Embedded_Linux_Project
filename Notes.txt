NOTE:
To input chars in the thonny program do the following in the terminal:
	$ stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 115200 -ixon -ixoff
	$ echo p >> /dev/ttyACM0
	
To turn on led's off and on:
	10.42.0.222/led/yellow/off
From terminal
	curl -s "10.42.0.222/led/red/off" >/dev/null

To source on startup:
	echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

./Bash_Files/Logging/Host_html.sh runs the server to host the log
	See it at http://10.42.0.1:8000/Plots/ in the browser
./Bash_Files/Logging/Log_Reset.sh resets the log
./Bash_Files/Logging/Logger.sh $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 Logs everything
	Moisture_Level=$1
	Ambient_Light=$2
	Pump_Active=$3
	Pump_Water_Alarm=$4
	Plant_Water_Alarm=$5

To kill background ros2 nodes:
	ps aux | grep ros2
	then then kill the apropriate things with:
	kill "number", example kill 2202

To restart the ros2 launch system startup instance:
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl restart ros2_autostart.service
    Use this to see the serivces status:
	sudo systemctl status ros2_autostart.service

	If you do this after colcon build it should just run the new launch file and get rid of the old nodes

Security:
	Setting up ssh-key for RPi
		if not using existing key, which can be found in ~/.ssh, use:
			ssh-keygen -t ed25519
		copy the key to the RPi using:		
			ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/key_name.pub pi@10.42.0.1

Things for the report:
        Write about the use of services and clients instead of pub/sub.
	Conditional execution based on, when nodes terminates.
