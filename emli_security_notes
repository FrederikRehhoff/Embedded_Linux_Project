security test:
	
	bluetooth:
		disable bluetooth by doing the following:
		- sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service (disable the Bluetooth service)
		- sudo systemctl mask bluetooth.service (revents bluetooth from being started even if other processes try to start it)
		test bluetooth ativity:
		- systemctl status bluetooth

	password requirment on every sudo:
	- sudo visudo
	change to:
	Defaults        env_reset
	Defaults        timestamp_timeout=0

	how to unban IPs:
	- sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip IP_addr
	
	fail2ban settings:
		- sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
		- sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
		Change the bantime to 10 minuts and the max_entry to 3
		use these commands to the see the status of the fail2ban service:
		- sudo fail2ban-client status
		- sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
	
	nftables.conf:
		added the following to the chain input:
		        
		        type filter hook input priority 0;
			policy drop;

			# Allow established connections
			ct state established,related accept

			# Allow loopback traffic
			iif lo accept

			# Allow SSH traffic
			tcp dport 22 accept

			# Allow HTTP traffic
			tcp dport 80 accept

			# Allow DHCP traffic
			udp dport 67 accept

			# Allow SimpleHTTPServer traffic (port 8000)
			tcp dport 8000 accept

		use the following command to see the status of the rules
		- sudo nft list ruleset
		
		use the following command to see the status of the firewall (blocked or dropped traffic.):
		- sudo journalctl -u nftables.service
		
		use nmap to see which port is open:
		- nmap <Raspberry Pi IP address>












Demonstration:
	
	bluetooth:
	- systemctl status bluetooth

	Fail2Ban:
	- sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
	
	nftables changes:
	- nmap 10.42.0.1
